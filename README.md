# **Lane Assistance Functional Safety**
---

**In this project, I have worked on the functional safety case documents for a simplified version of Lane Assistance System.**

## Project Overview
---
The goal of this project is creating the documents for a functional safety case for a simplified version of a lane assistance system. The functional safety case documents shall follow the international functional safety standard [ISO 26262](https://www.iso.org/standard/43464.html). 

>The ISO 26262, titled "Road vehicles â€“ Functional safety", is an international standard for functional safety of electrical and/or electronic systems in production automobiles defined by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 2011.
**From Wikipedia**

### The functional safety case consists of the following documents:
---
- Safety Plan
- Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA)
- Functional Safety Concept
- Technical Safety Concept
- Software Requirements and Architecture

The [Udacity SDCND Functional Safety project with EB](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Functional-Safety-Project) are providing the base documents for these project, along with the architecture diagrams.

## Conclusion
---
  * Any product will have a set of requirements or functions describing what the product is. Functional Safety makes sure that these functions does not lead to injury or harm
  * In automotive industry, functional safety specifically refer to reducing risks in electrical/electronic systems
  * ISO 26262 is the standard that uses system engineering to methodically reduce risk in passenger vehicles' E/E systems
